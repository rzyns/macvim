In order for us to catch simple bugs when new snapshots are released Nico Weber has proposed a sort of "smoke test".  It would be good if everybody testing a new snapshot would go through these simple steps and let me know if something fails.  Please leave a comment if you have any other tests that should be added to this list.

Things to test for in a new snapshot:
  * Check if ⌘N ⌘W ⌘W ⌘N ⌘⇧F ⌘Q works
  * Check if clicking the "open" button on the toolbar works
  * ⌘N ⌘N ⌘`, then see if opening a file from "open recent" works
  * Hit ⌘= and ⌘- a few times and see if font size changes
  * Grab the window resize box and drag it rapidly across the screen for a few seconds
  * (optional) If you use the input manager, check if editing a textfield in safari works
