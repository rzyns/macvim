MacVim is the text editor Vim for Mac OS X.

![![](http://macvim.googlecode.com/files/MacVim-screenshot-10-detail.jpg)](http://macvim.googlecode.com/files/MacVim-screenshot-10.jpg)

MacVim supports multiple windows with tabbed editing and a host of other features such as:
  * bindings to standard OS X keyboard shortcuts (⌘Z, ⌘V, ⌘A, ⌘G, etc.),
  * transparent backgrounds,
  * full-screen mode,
  * multibyte editing with OS X input methods and automatic font substitution,
  * ODB editor support,
and more.  Most importantly, MacVim brings you the full power of Vim 7.4 to Mac OS X.

# Help #

Many common problems can be solved by going through the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/wiki/Troubleshooting).  Failing that, there are two Google groups where you can ask Vim-related questions:

  * [vim\_use](http://groups.google.com/group/vim_use): for general questions on how to use Vim.
  * [vim\_mac](http://groups.google.com/group/vim_mac): for questions that are specific to using Vim on Mac OS X.

Please [read the guidelines](http://www.vim.org/maillist.php) before posting.  In particular, please do not top-post when replying to messages.  That is, type your reply below the text you are replying to and remove irrelevant text from the original.

Note that you do not need to subscribe to email notifications when signing up for either of these groups. You can read the groups online if you would rather keep your inbox clean. These groups are moderated so your first post may take up to a day before it arrives to the group (subsequent posts should show up within a few minutes).


# Move to GitHub #

The MacVim [source code](http://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) and [wiki](http://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/wiki) is hosted on GitHub.  The issue tracker is still hosted on this site however, but we'll move it to GitHub soon due to Google Code shutting down.
